================

My very personal opinionated Isomorphic React Golden Setup

- React component dependencies resolved using ES6 modules
- Browser bundling via browserify
- CDN dependencies' shim via browserify-shim
- Transpiled from ES6/JSX to ES5 via babelify
- Minified via gulp-uglify
- JSX Source maps working with the minified bundles via gulp-sourcemaps
- Linted via eslint + babel-eslint
- Tasks via gulp

Todo:
- Run ESLint from gulp
- Configure browserify-shim from gulp
